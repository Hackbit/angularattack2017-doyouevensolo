## Synopsis
Pick-a-winner is a web app that helps Instagram users randomly select winners for their Instagram giveaways. 

## Motivation
I actively use [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/handmadewithashley/) for interacting with woodworkers. Something that's common amoung the woodworking community on Instagram (this may be true for many other communities as well) is having a giveway.  If a user wishes to participate in a giveway it usually involves following users **x** and **y**, posting a comment on **z** photo, and posting a photo on the user's feed with the hashtag **w**. The winner of the giveway is randomly selected from users that met that criteria. I've seen several users do this manually. I thought creating a web app to help manage the selection of giveway winners would be a neat and fun idea to work on. 

## Install

```
npm install
```

```
cd pick-a-winner
```

```
ng serve
```
Navigate to http://localhost:4200/.
